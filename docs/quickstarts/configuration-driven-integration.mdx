In this quickstart we'll look at how you can use several types of config variables and connections to drive logic in your integration.
This helps to illustrate how your customers can have instances of the same integration deployed to them, with different configurations.

## Basic config variables

The most basic type of config variable is a simple string.
A string config variable can have an optional default value, and you can add **Description** helper text to indicate to your end user what type of string the config variable expects.

For example, we can create a config variable that prompts the user for their API endpoint:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/simple-string-config-var.png"
  alt="Simple string config variable"
/>

When your user configures an instance of the integration, they're prompted for the string and they're provided the helper text you added:

  alt="Simple string prompt"
  maxWidth="700px"
/>

You can use the string that your user entered as an input for one or more steps:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/simple-string-as-input.png"
  alt="Simple string as input"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>

Or, you can concatenate the string together with other static strings, config variables, and step results, to generate dynamic inputs for steps:

  alt="Simple string in template"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>

## Creating dropdown menus and branching from options

If you'd like to limit the options an end user can choose from, select **picklist** as your config variable data type.
You can generate a list of options that your user can choose from:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/picklist-config-var.png"
  alt="Picklist config variable"
  maxWidth="500px"
/>

When deploying an instance of the integration, your user will see a dropdown menu with the options you created:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/picklist-config-wizard.png"
  alt="Picklist input in the config wizard"
  maxWidth="700px"
/>

These config variables can be used like you use string config variables (above).

You can also drive branching logic from a picklist by adding a branch for each picklist option.

  alt="Create a branch from a picklist"
  maxWidth="800px"
/>

## Prompting for lists of values

Sometimes it's handy to have a user enter one or more values for a config variable (think "arrays" in JavaScript or "lists" in Python).
Create a config variable, and select **List** as the **Config Var Type**.

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/list-config-var.png"
  alt="List of strings in a config variable"
  maxWidth="700px"
/>

Users can enter one or more values for the config variable

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/list-config-wizard.png"
  alt="List config var in config wizard"
  maxWidth="550px"
/>

If you reference that config variable in steps of your integration, the code backing your step will receive an array of strings rather than a single string.

## Branching on boolean config variables

You may want to prompt a user with a "yes/no" question, and drive some logic based on their answer.
First, create a boolean input.

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/boolean-config-var.png"
  alt="Boolean type config variable"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>

The end user will see a simple toggle in their configuration wizard.

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/configuration-driven-integration/boolean-config-wizard.png"
  alt="Boolean in the config wizard"
  maxWidth="200px"
/>

Create a **Branch on Expression** step, and have one branch run if the value "is true" (otherwise, it'll follow the other branch)

  alt="Branch based on boolean config var value"
