title: Wrapping an API in a Component
description: Learn how to write a custom component that wraps an HTTP-base third-party API
---

import Screenshot from "@site/src/components/screenshot";

Component authors are frequently asked to develop a component that implements a series of API calls for some third-party service (or possibly your own company's API).
If the API you're creating a component for has an OpenAPI or WSDL spec, you can have `prism` [generate a component](custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#custom-components-from-wsdls-or-openapi-specs) based off of your YAML, JSON, or XML spec file.

If, however, your API does not have an OpenAPI or WSDL spec, or if you're just looking to implement actions for a small handful of endpoints, we have some "best practices" you can follow for developing a custom component that implements those endpoints.
The code for our custom component is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/-io/examples/tree/main/components/acmeerp).
Let's dive into the code here.

## Our component's spec

For today's tutorial, suppose we're writing a component for "Acme ERP" - a made-up ERP system, and we would like to implement actions for a subset of endpoints that the Acme ERP API offers.
We're handed a few specs for our component:

- Customers each have distinct instances of Acme ERP, so the API endpoint is different for each customer.
- Customers authenticate by entering an API key that they generate.
- For our first integration, there are four endpoints that we want actions for:
  - **List All Items**: This is a GET call to the API's `/items/` endpoint which returns an array of items in our inventory.
  - **Get Item**: This is a GET call to `/items/{ ITEM_ID }` and fetches a single item from our inventory by ID.
  - **Add Item**: This is a POST call to `/items/` to add an item to our inventory.
  - **Delete Item**: This is a DELETE call to `/items/{ ITEM_ID }` to delete an item from inventory.

## Initializing the component

Like any new custom component, we can create our new component using a subcommand of [prism](cli/cli-usage.mdx):

```bash title="Initialize our component"
$ prism components:init acmeerp
Creating component directory for "acmeerp"...

"acmeerp" is ready for development.
To install dependencies, run either "npm install" or "yarn install"
To test the component, run "npm run test" or "yarn test"
To build the component, run "npm run build" or "yarn build"
To publish the component, run "prism components:publish"

For documentation on writing custom components, visit https://.io/docs/custom-components/writing-custom-components/
```

Then, I'll install my package's dependencies using `yarn` (though, you can use `npm`, too):

```bash title="Install package dependencies"
$ yarn
yarn install v1.22.10
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
‚ú®  Done in 7.48s.
```

I'm not going to implement any custom triggers with this component (if you're interested in writing triggers, please see [this quickstart](quickstarts/writing-a-trigger.mdx)), so I'm going to remove `src/triggers.ts` and in `src/index.ts` I'll remove the lines related to triggers.
While I'm at it, I'll give my component a proper label and description:

```typescript {3,15} title="Remove trigger boilerplate"
import { component } from "@-io/spectral";
import actions from "./actions";
import triggers from "./triggers";
import connections from "./connections";

export default component({
  key: "acmeerp",
  public: false,
  display: {
    label: "Acme ERP",
    description: "Manage inventory in Acme ERP",
    iconPath: "icon.png",
  },
  actions,
  triggers,
  connections,
});
```

I'll also remove `src/index.test.ts`, as I'll implement unit testing later.

## Creating a shared HTTP client

Our component needs to reach out to a variable endpoint, and needs to accept an API Key.
So, our connections will need to contain both endpoint and credential information
To handle those things, let's create a function that takes a connection, and returns an HTTP client pointed at that endpoint.
At we really like [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), but you can use another HTTP client library if you like one better.

```bash title="Add Axios to our project"
$ yarn add axios
yarn add v1.22.10
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...

info Direct dependencies
info All dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ axios@0.24.0
‚îî‚îÄ follow-redirects@1.14.5
‚ú®  Done in 6.47s.
```

Let's first create a `connection`, which will contain the information needed to connect to Acme ERP: the customer's unique endpoint URL and the customer's API key.

```typescript title="src/connections.ts"
import { connection } from "@-io/spectral";

// Create a connection that contains an API endpoint URL
// and an API key.
export const apiKeyConnection = connection({
  key: "apiKey",
  label: "Acme Connection",
  comments: "Acme Connection",
  inputs: {
    endpoint: {
      label: "Acme Endpoint URL",
      placeholder: "Acme Endpoint URL",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      comments: "Acme API Endpoint URL",
      default: "https://my-json-server.typicode.com/-io/placeholder-data",
      example: "https://my-company.api.acme.com/",
    },
    apiKey: {
      label: "Acme API Key",
      placeholder: "Acme API Key",
      type: "password",
      required: true,
      comments: "Generate at https://app.acme.com/settings/api-keys",
    },
  },
});

export default [apiKeyConnection];
```

Then, we'll create a helper function, `getAcmeErpClient`, which will take a connection input and create an HTTP client pointed at the connection's endpoint URL and authenticated with the connection's API key.
Let's place this code in a new file called `auth.ts`:

```typescript title="src/auth.ts"
import axios from "axios";
import { Connection, util } from "@-io/spectral";

export function getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection: Connection) {
  const { apiKey, endpoint } = acmeConnection.fields;

  // Return an HTTP client that has been configured to point
  // towards endpoint URL, and passes an API key as a header
  return axios.create({
    baseURL: util.types.toString(endpoint),
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json", // Our API returns JSON
      Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    },
    maxContentLength: Infinity,
    maxBodyLength: Infinity,
  });
}
```

Now, each of our actions simply need to pass in a connection to the `getAcmeErpClient` function, and they'll be able to make HTTP calls to the Acme ERP API.

If we build and publish this component now, we can create a new connection config variable for our integration and fill in our API key and endpoint URL:

## Write some actions

Now it's time to implement our actions.
Remember, we want to create four actions that list all items in our inventory, list a specific item, delete a specific item, and add an item to our inventory.

### List all items action

Let's start with the "list all items" action.
This action will take a single input - the connection we just defined.

Let's keep our inputs organized, so we'll create a new file, `src/inputs.ts`, with that single input for now that represents our connection (customer's API endpoint and api key).
At the top of the file, we'll import the `input` type function from our [custom component SDK](spectral/custom-component-library.mdx) library:

```typescript title="src/inputs.ts - Endpoint URL Input"
import { input } from "@-io/spectral";

export const connectionInput = input({
  label: "Acme ERP",
  required: true,
  type: "connection",
});
```

Next, let's replace the contents of `src/actions.ts`.
We'll import `action` and helper `util` functions from our custom component SDK, our input from `inputs.ts`, and auth and HTTP client info from `auth.ts`.
Then, we'll add a definition for our "list all items" action:

```typescript title="src/actions.ts - List All Items Action"
import { action } from "@-io/spectral";
import { getAcmeErpClient } from "./auth";
import { connectionInput } from "./inputs";

const listAllItems = action({
  display: {
    label: "List All Items",
    description: "List all items in our inventory",
  },
  inputs: {
    // Declare an input for this action
    acmeConnection: connectionInput,
  },
  perform: async (context, { acmeConnection }) => {
    // Initialize our HTTP client
    const acmeErpClient = getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection);

    // Make a synchronous GET call to "{ endpoint }/items":
    const response = await acmeErpClient.get("/items/");

    // Return the data that we got back
    return { data: response.data };
  },
  // Show an example payload in the  UI:
  examplePayload: {
    data: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Widgets",
        quantity: 20,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Whatsits",
        quantity: 100,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

At this point we can run `yarn build` and `prism components:publish` to publish our single-action component to .
If we add our action to an integration, we can see that the step takes the connection input we specified:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/wrapping-an-api-in-a-component/first-action-inputs.png"
  alt="Acme ERP - List all Items in  integration designer"
  maxWidth="850px"
/>

We can also reference the example payload that our action declares in a subsequent step:

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/wrapping-an-api-in-a-component/first-action-results.png"
  alt="Acme ERP - Write Log Message in  integration designer"
  maxWidth="850px"
/>

### Get item action

Next, let's build another action that fetches a specific item from our API's inventory.
This action will reuse the same `connectionInput` input that we declared previously, and will also require an `itemIdInput` input, to specify the ID of the item we want to fetch:

```typescript title="src/inputs.ts - Item ID Input"
export const itemIdInput = input({
  label: "Item ID",
  required: true,
  type: "string",
});
```

The "get item" action will be very similar to the previous action - it'll initialize an HTTP client and return some data.
The `display`, `inputs`, `perform` logic, and `examplePayload` will differ slightly, but the bulk of the action will be the same as before:

```typescript title="src/actions.ts - Get Item Action"
import { connectionInput, itemIdInput } from "./inputs";

// ...

const getItem = action({
  display: {
    label: "Get Item",
    description: "Get an Item by ID",
  },
  inputs: {
    acmeConnection: connectionInput,
    itemId: itemIdInput,
  },
  perform: async (context, { acmeConnection, itemId }) => {
    const acmeErpClient = getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection);
    const response = await acmeErpClient.get(`/items/${itemId}`);
    return { data: response.data };
  },
  examplePayload: {
    data: {
      id: 1,
      name: "Widgets",
      quantity: 20,
    },
  },
});

export default { getItem, listAllItems };
```

### Delete item action

At this point, we "rinse and repeat" - the "delete an item" action will get an HTTP client, send a DELETE HTTP request to an endpoint, and this time return nothing (since a DELETE of an item on our API returns nothing).
Our "delete an item" action will take an endpoint URL and item ID, like the "get an item" action:

```typescript title="src/actions.ts - Delete an Item Action"
const deleteItem = action({
  display: {
    label: "Delete Item",
    description: "Delete an Item by ID",
  },
  inputs: {
    acmeConnection: connectionInput,
    itemId: itemIdInput,
  },
  perform: async (context, { acmeConnection, itemId }) => {
    const acmeErpClient = getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection);
    const response = await acmeErpClient.delete(`/items/${itemId}`);
    return { data: null };
  },
});

export default { deleteItem, getItem, listAllItems };
```

### Add an item action

The "add an item" action has a couple subtle differences from the other three actions:

- It takes additional inputs (`name` and `quanity`).
  These inputs are not shared by other actions, so we can define them in-line.
- The HTTP call we use is a POST call, and we pass our `name` and `quantity` inputs to the API as POST parameters.

The reset of the action is very similar to the previous actions:

```typescript title="src/actions.ts - Add Item Action"
const addItem = action({
  display: {
    label: "Add Item",
    description: "Add an Item to Inventory",
  },
  // We can define some inputs inline if they're not reused:
  inputs: {
    acmeConnection: connectionInput,
    name: input({ label: "Item Name", type: "string" }),
    quantity: input({ label: "Item Quantity", type: "string" }),
  },
  perform: async (context, { acmeConnection, name, quantity }) => {
    const acmeErpClient = getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection);
    const response = await acmeErpClient.post("/items/", {
      name,
      quantity,
    });
    return { data: response.data };
  },
  // This API call returns the item object that was created:
  examplePayload: {
    data: {
      id: 1,
      name: "Widgets",
      quantity: 20,
    },
  },
});

export default { addItem, deleteItem, getItem, listAllItems };
```

## Unit testing our component

Now that we've implemented our four actions for our component, let's add some [unit tests](custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#unit-tests-for-custom-components) to verify that our actions return what we'd expect them to return.
To do that, we'll create a new file, `src/actions.test.ts`.

We can import a helper function from 's SDK - `invoke`.
Then, we can import the actions that we want to test (we'll test "add an item" here) and we can invoke the action and verify that the `result` we receive is what we expect:

```typescript title="src/actions.test.ts - Unit Test the Add Item Action"
import { invoke, createConnection } from "@-io/spectral/dist/testing";
import { apiKeyConnection } from "./connections";
import actions from "./actions";

const acmeConnection = createConnection(apiKeyConnection, {
  endpoint: "https://my-json-server.typicode.com/-io/placeholder-data",
  apiKey: process.env.ACME_ERP_API_KEY, // Get API key from an environment variable
});

describe("test the add item action", () => {
  test("test that we get back what we sent", async () => {
    const name = "widgets";
    const quantity = 123;
    const { result } = await invoke(
      actions.addItem, // Invoke the "addItem" action
      { acmeConnection, name, quantity } // Pass in some inputs that we declared
    );
    expect(result.data.name).toEqual(name); // Verify that the response had the same item name
    expect(result.data.quantity).toEqual(quantity); // Verify that the response had the same item quantity
  });
});
```
