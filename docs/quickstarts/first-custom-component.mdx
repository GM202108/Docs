In this tutorial we will create a Slack component from scratch to illustrate how readily you can write custom code for an integration.

## Initialize your project

Suppose 's [Slack component](components/slack.mdx) did not exist. How would one go about creating a component that sends notifications to Slack?

To start your integration, use the `prism components:init` subcommand to create a new TypeScript project.

```bash
# Initialize the project
prism components:init myslack

Creating component directory for "myslack"...
? Description of Component: My Slack Component
? Type of Connection: Basic Connection
   create package.json
   create assets/icon.png
   create src/index.ts
   create src/index.test.ts
   create src/client.ts
   create jest.config.js
   create tsconfig.json
   create webpack.config.js
   create src/actions.ts
   create src/triggers.ts
   create src/connections.ts

# Move to the newly created directory
cd myslack

# Pull down the Slack icon for use by the component
curl 'https://.io/docs/img/slack.png' > assets/icon.png

# Remove all boilerplate code; we'll write this component from scratch
rm src/*.ts
```

This will create a NodeJS project with TypeScript support, complete with required dependencies, like Webpack and 's custom component library, [spectral](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@-io/spectral).

## Add dependencies

Most of the dependencies you require have been added for you, but because you're building a [Slack](https://slack.com/) component, you will want to take advantage of the Slack webhook npm package.

```bash
npm install @slack/webhook
```

Add the following to the top of a new file, `src/index.ts`:

```js title="src/index.ts"
import { action, component, input, util } from "@-io/spectral";
import { IncomingWebhook } from "@slack/webhook";
```

## Create some input fields

What information will you need to send a Slack message? At minimum, we'll need two things:

1. A Slack webhook URL to send messages to
1. A message to send.

To create those input fields for your component, you will create two new `input`s in `src/index.ts`.
The `label` and `placeholder` will appear within the  web app when a user utilizes this action. `type` and `required` are self-explanatory.

Each input has a `clean` function, which helps with type hinting - the `util.types.toString` function will guarantee that the value of `webhookUrl` and `message` is cast to a string.

```js title="src/index.ts"
const webhookUrl = input({
  label: "Webhook URL",
  placeholder: "Slack Webhook URL",
  type: "string",
  required: true,
  clean: util.types.toString,
});
const message = input({
  label: "Message",
  placeholder: "Message to send",
  type: "string",
  required: true,
  clean: util.types.toString,
});
```

## Create a component action

Now it's time to create an `action` that our component can take.
You need to provide the action with a `label` and `description` to display in the web app, a set of `input`s that you created above, and some code to `perform` when the action is invoked.
You can take advantage of the Slack API in our `perform` function.

```js title="src/index.ts"
const postSlackMessage = action({
  display: {
    label: "Slack Message",
    description: "Post a message to a Slack channel",
  },
  perform: async (context, params) => {
    const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(params.webhookUrl);
    const result = await webhook.send({ text: params.message });
    return { data: result };
  },
  inputs: { webhookUrl, message },
});
```

## Export your component

Lastly, we need to export a `component` object that has a unique `key` to identify it in , contains a `label` and `description` to display in the web app, and an object containing the `actions` that are associated with the component.

```js title="src/index.ts"
export default component({
  key: "newSlack",
  public: false,
  display: {
    label: "New Slack",
    description: "Post messages to Slack",
    iconPath: "icon.png",
  },
  actions: { postSlackMessage },
});
```

## Build and deploy your component

At this point you're ready to compile your component, and then deploy it.
The `build` script leverages [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile and minify your TypeScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

Your build exists in `dist/`.
Now, you can use `prism` to deploy your component.

```bash
prism components:publish
```

## Test your new component

Congratulations! You've published your first custom component!
Try modifying your [first integration](getting-started/first-integration/build-first-integration.mdx) to use your new component, and verify that it posts to Slack like the official  Slack component does!
