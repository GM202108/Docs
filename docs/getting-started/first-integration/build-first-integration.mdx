This tutorial will walk you through some basic concepts of integration development.
You will:

- Fetch data from a third-party "app"
- Learn how data flows between steps of an integration
- Use a loop to iterate over the data you fetch
- Use logical branches to determine what to do with the data
- Send the data conditionally to another third-party

## Integration overview

The integration you build here will fetch data (a list of to-do tasks) from an API, loops over the list, determine which tasks are marked "incomplete", and notify you via Slack of any "incomplete" tasks.
[Placeholder data](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/-io/placeholder-data/todo) will stand in as a placeholder for the to-do list "API".

/>

You'll design this integration to be **configurable**, so the same integration can be deployed to multiple customers with unique API endpoints and Slack Webhook URLs.

## Prerequisites

To run this integration, you will need to have a Slack account (you can create one for free) and generate a [Slack webhook](components/slack.mdx#webhook-url).
Take note of the webhook you generate.
It should be of the form `https://hooks.slack.com/services/SOME/API/KEY`.

## Create a new integration

Click **Integrations** from the left-hand sidebar, and then click **+ Add integration** in the upper-right.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/add-integration.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Integrations page in  app"
/>

Give the integration a name of "_My First Integration_".
You can choose to give your integration an optional description, and can categorize the integration if you wish, though both fields can be left blank.

After clicking **Next**, select an integration trigger.
An integration's trigger determines what should cause the integration to run.
For this integration, select a **Schedule** Trigger, which allows you to run the integration on a schedule (once a day, once an hour, etc).
After selecting the trigger, you'll find yourself in the integration designer.

### Configure the integration trigger

First, let's determine what will cause this integration to run.

Click on the integration trigger.
This will open a configuration drawer on the left side of the screen.
Then, click **Add a value** in the **Schedule** field.
Configure the trigger to run once daily at a time of your choosing:

/>

### Pull down to-do data

Your first step is responsible for fetching data from the to-do API.
Add an **HTTP - GET Request** action by clicking the <Icon>add_circle</Icon> button below the trigger and searching for the **HTTP** component.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/add-http-action-1.png"
  maxWidth="650px"
  alt="HTTP Component selection in  app"
/>

Select the **HTTP** component, and then select the **Get Request** action.

  maxWidth="650px"
  alt="Get Request action selection for HTTP Component in  app"
/>

#### Make the URL configurable

Now we need to tell the step where to look for the to-do API.
We should make this configurable, so one customer could look at one endpoint, and another customer could look at another endpoint.

Click the URL field in the left-hand side of your screen and open the **Config Variables** tab.
Click <Icon>add_circle</Icon> next to the dropdown to create a new config variable.
Within the dialogue that pops up name the new config variable **To-Do API Endpoint** and set this as its default value:

`https://my-json-server.typicode.com/-io/placeholder-data/todo`

Click **Accept** to save this config variable and use it as input to this step.

The **Response Type** field should keep its default **JSON** value and you can leave all other input fields alone.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-http-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Configure HTTP action in  app"
/>

At this point you should test your single-step integration to verify your first step pulls to-do data from the to-do API successfully.

Click **SAVE & RUN TEST** button to save and run your integration.
This will open the **TEST RUNNER** drawer.
If you open up the **Step Outputs** tab, you should see the data retrieved from the to-do API:

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/test-http-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Test HTTP action in  app"
/>

The important thing to note here is that those step results (the list of to-do items in this case) are available to use in subsequent steps.

### Loop over to-do tasks

Add another action by clicking the <Icon>add_circle</Icon> icon below the action you just added.
This time choose the **Loop** component, **Loop Over Items** action.

Let the step know what items to loop over by clicking the **Items** input, and from within the **Reference Search** box that comes up, enter `results`.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-loop-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Loop over items in  app"
/>

Click **SAVE & RUN TEST** again.
In the **Step Outputs** tab, you'll now see the results of the loop step.
Note that it has a `currentItem` value - this represents the to-do task that is currently being looped over.
We'll use that value for the next step.

  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/test-loop-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Test loop action in  app"
/>

### Check if a to-do task is completed

Now you need to determine if each to-do task is complete or not, so you can send incomplete tasks as Slack messages.

Within the loop, add a new step.
This time select the **Branch** component, **Branch on Expression** action.

Create a branch named "Completed".
Under **Field** open the **Reference** tab and select your loop step as the **Reference Step**.
Enter `currentItem.completed` as the **Reference Search**.
Under the **Operator** drop down, select `is true` to check if the current to-do item's `completed` value is `true`.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-branch-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Configure branch action in  app"
/>

### Post the message to Slack

We want to send a Slack message when a task is _not_ complete.
So, add a **Slack** component, **Slack Message From Webhook** action under the **Else** branch.

In the **Message** input field choose a **Reference**, select the **Loop Over To-Do Items** as your **Reference Step** and enter `currentItem.task` for the **Reference Search**:

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-slack-action.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Configure Slack action in  app"
/>

This will instruct the Slack component to send the current tasks's description as a Slack message.

#### Configure the Slack connection

A **connection** is a config variable that contains the information necessary for a step in your integration to interact with an external app or service.
Connections often contain endpoints, usernames, API keys, etc.
In this case, we want to configure Slack to use a specific webhook URL (the one you created [above](#prerequisites)) to send messages.
Note that the **Connection** input has already been populated with a connection config variable for you.

Open up the **Configuration Wizard** from the button on the right side of the screen and open the **Slack Connection** config variable that was created for you.
Under **Connection Type**, change it to a **Slack**, **Webhook URL**.

Open up the connection's **Webhook URL** input and give it a default value of the Slack webhook URL you configured [above](#prerequisites):

  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/slack-default-webhook-url.png"
  alt="Set Slack default webhook URL in  app"
/>

## Test the integration

Now it's time to test your integration to verify it works properly.

Click the **Save & Run Test** button once more.
Then, open the **Test Runner** tab from the left-hand sidebar.
You'll see output from your test run.
By clicking through **Step Outputs** you can see the output that each step generated.
You should see several "incomplete" to-do tasks appear in your Slack channel as the integration runs.

## Tidy up your integration

Though it's not necessary, it's helpful to add descriptive names to each of your integration's steps so your team members know exactly what each one does.
You can also add a step under the **Completed** branch to do something with completed to-do items if you'd like.

  alt="Sample integration diagram in  app"
/>

## Publish the integration

Now that you have a working integration, it's time to publish it so it can be deployed to customers.

Open the **Version History** tab on the left-hand side.
Enter a publication message so others know what you've changed, and then click the **Save & Publish** button.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You created your first integration! Here are a few things you should try next:

- Alter the Slack message you're sending using [template inputs](building-integrations.mdx#template-inputs).
- Swap out the HTTP GET action for a different data source component (perhaps pull from an [SFTP](components/sftp.mdx) server)?
- Write your message out to a file in [Dropbox](components/dropbox.mdx) or [Amazon S3](components/aws-s3.mdx) instead of Slack.

When you are ready, move on to the next tutorial to [deploy your integration](getting-started/first-integration/deploy-first-integration.mdx) to a customer.
