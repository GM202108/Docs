description: The benefit of having your app and integration logs all in one place.

You are probably already using a logging platform like Datadog or New Relic. If so, you understand the benefit of having access to various logs in a single place. You can also configure  to [stream its logs](/logging/#external-log-streaming) into the same platform alongside the logs from your core application.

Doing this makes it much easier to troubleshoot issues when they occur. For example, an integration fails at 3:02 AM, and you can see an exclusive table lock issue in the application's database that occurred right before that integration failure.

Working with your  logs through a logging platform also makes it very easy to keep track of things like how often an integration runs and how long it takes a particular integration to run. The data logging platforms usually have a robust dashboard setup that allows you to access your most important stats.

And, even if you are not using a third-party logging platform,  gives your customer-facing teams easy access to the integration logs.
