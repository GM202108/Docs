title: Use Alert Monitors
description: Alert monitors aren't just for issues, be sure you are using them for everything necessary.
---

The system has built-in alert monitoring that you can set up for any integration. This allows you to receive an alert when an instance runs into an issue. Or, you can create an alert monitor to let you know every time an instance is activated or when an instance runs successfully â€“ alert monitoring doesn't just work for the negative.

You can also choose where the alerts are sent, whether to email or whatever else you are using for your incident response system (such as [PagerDuty](/monitoring-and-alerting/#sending-incidents-to-pagerduty-with-alert-webhooks) or Slack).
