The integration designer provides a sandbox for testing integrations.
From the designer you can invoke an integration, configure test values for config variables, and view test logs in real time.

You can test your integration after you set test values for config variables by clicking the **SAVE & RUN TEST** button.

If your integration is made up of multiple [flows](building-integrations.mdx#flows-in-integrations), each flow is tested independently.
Click the flow name on the top left of the integration designer area, select the flow you would like to test, and then click **SAVE & RUN TEST**.
Note that each flow has a distinct webhook URL, so if you are invoking the integration from a third-party app via webhook, you'll need to note the flow's webhook URL.

## Test config variables

If your integration uses config variables, you can specify testing values for those variables under the **Configuration** tab of the **Test Runner** drawer.
If you specified default values for your [config variables](building-integrations.mdx#config-variables-in-integrations), those will be preset for you.
Otherwise, fill in testing values and credentials for the purposes of testing your integration.

We recommend that you create testing, non-production sandbox credentials for integration tests.

## Test run outputs

After running an integration test, the output of each step is available in the **Step Outputs** tab of the **Test Runner** drawer.
Select which step you would like to see results for from the dropdown menu.
You can reference those results in subsequent steps.
This is helpful for debugging and verifying the flow of data within your integration.

## Test run logs

Output for your test run is displayed under the **Logs** tab in the **Test Runner** drawer.
If any of your steps log output or throw errors, you will see those logs and errors in this window.

## Testing a webhook trigger

An integration can be invoked via webhook.
This is useful if you have a third-party system that sends data to an integration to be processed.

To test a webhook invocation of an integration, open the **Trigger** tab of the **Test Runner** drawer and take note of the "POST URL".

  filename="integrations/test-trigger.png"
  maxWidth="600px"
  alt="Test webhook trigger in  app"
/>

You can use that URL to invoke a test of your integration, just as you would to invoke an execution of a deployed instance - see our [webhook trigger](integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-triggers) docs.
You can also specify a **test payload body** to be processed by the integration, and if your integration requires custom HTTP **headers**, those can be specified under the test payload body.

### Replaying test invocations

:::tip Time-saving tip
Just like [instance replays](instances.mdx#instance-execution-retry-and-replay), you can replay a test integration invocation.
That comes in handy if you are testing an integration invocation from a third-party app.
You don't need to set up your third-party environment every time - you can fire off a webhook invocation once from your third-party app with a payload, and run that same payload through your integration until you're happy with the results.
:::

To replay a test integration invocation, open the **Test Runner** drawer and click into the **Runner** tab.
Click the <Icon>replay</Icon> icon to the right of the test that you would like to replay.

  maxWidth="500px"
  alt="Replay test integration invocation in  app"
/>

The payload that was sent to trigger this integration test will be fed back into another test of the integration.
This allows you to make changes to your integration and iterate quickly, without needing to reconfigure your third-party apps and services to fire new webhook requests over and over.
