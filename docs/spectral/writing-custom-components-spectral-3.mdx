## Overview

 is extensible and allows for developer users to develop their own custom components.
Components that  users develop are proprietary to their [organization](organization.mdx), and are private.

[Sample component code](https://github.com/-io/examples/tree/main/components/format-name) is referenced throughout this page.

## Custom Component Library

 provides a NodeJS package, [@-io/spectral](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@-io/spectral), which provides TypeScript typing and some utility functions.
Source code for Spectral is available on [github](https://github.com/-io/spectral).

For information on Spectral's utility functions and types, see our [custom component library](spectral/custom-component-library.mdx) docs.

## Initializing a New Component

To initialize a new project, run `prism components:init {{ COMPONENT NAME }}`.
If you do not have 's CLI tool, `prism`, installed, please take a moment to look through the [Prism overview page](cli/cli-usage.mdx).

```bash
prism components:init format-name
```

Your component name must be comprised of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores, and start and end with alphanumeric characters.
This will create a directory structure that looks like this:

```
format-name
├── assets
│   └── icon.png
├── jest.config.js
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── index.test.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

- `assets/icon.png` is the icon that will be displayed next to your component
  Square transparent PNGs at least 128 x 128 pixels in size look best, and will be scaled by the web app appropriately.
- `jest.config.js` contains configuration for the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework
- `package.json` is a standard node package definition file
- `src/index.ts` contains the code for your component. This file can be broken into multiple files as needed
- `src/index.test.ts` contains tests for component actions defined in `index.ts`.
  See [Unit Testing Custom Components](quickstarts/unit-testing-custom-components.mdx)
- `tsconfig.json` contains configuration for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- `webpack.config.js` contains configuration for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

After these files are created run `cd {{ COMPONENT_NAME }}` to enter the directory of your component, and then `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.

### Custom Components from WSDLs or OpenAPI Specs

Third-party apps and services often provide APIs with hundreds of RESTful endpoints.
It would be tedious to manually write actions for each individual endpoint.
Luckily, many companies also provide an API specification - commonly a [Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315) file, or an [OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification.

You can generate a custom component from a WSDL file with `prism` by passing the `--wsdl-path` flag to the `components:init` subcommand:

```bash
prism components:init myThirdPartyComponent --wsdl-path ./thirdPartySpec.wsdl
```

You can generate a custom component from an OpenAPI definition (you can use a YAML or JSON file - both work fine) with `prism` by passing the `--open-api-path` flag to the `components:init` subcommand:

```bash
prism components:init myThirdPartyComponent --open-api-path ./third-party-openapi-spec.json

# or

prism components:init myThirdPartyComponent --open-api-path ./third-party-openapi-spec.yaml
```

A directory will be created containing your new custom component, complete with `input`, `action`, and `component` definitions.

## Writing Actions

A component is comprised of one or many [actions](components.mdx#component-actions). For example, the [HTTP component](components/http.mdx) contains actions to [GET](components/http.mdx#httpget) (`httpGet`), [POST](components/http.mdx#post-request) (`httpPost`), etc.

An `action` has three required properties and one optional one:

1. Information on how the web app `display` the action
1. A function to `perform`
1. A series of `input` fields
1. (optional) An `authorization` block that describes what type(s) of credentials the action accepts.

```typescript
const myAction = action({
  display: {
    label: "Brief Description",
    description: "Longer description to display in web app UI",
  },
  perform: async (context, params) => {},
  inputs: { inputFieldOne, inputFieldTwo },
  // optional:
  authorization: {
    required: true,
    methods: ["basic", "oauth", "api_key"],
  },
});
```

### Adding Inputs

Components can take [`inputs`](components.mdx#inputs). Each `input` is comprised of a required `label`, and `type` and optional `placeholder`, `default`, `comments`, `required` and `model`.

Consider this example input:

```typescript
const middleName = input({
  label: "Middle Name",
  placeholder: "Middle name of a person",
  type: "string",
  required: false,
  default: "",
  comments: "Leave blank if the user has no middle name",
});
```

This contributes to an input prompt that looks like this:

<Screenshot
  filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/inputs.png"
  maxWidth="700px"
/>

Note where the `label` and `placeholder` text appeared in the web app, and note that First Name and Last Name are required - indicated with a `*`, but Middle Name is not.

### Component Input Types

An input can take a number of types, which affects how the input renders in the  web app:

- **string** will allow users to input or reference a string of characters.
  <Screenshot
    filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/input-types/string.png"
    maxWidth="300px"
  />
- **text** is similar to **string**, but allows for multi-line input.
  <Screenshot
    filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/input-types/text.png"
    maxWidth="400px"
  />
- **boolean** allows users to enter one of two values: true or false.
  <Screenshot
    filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/input-types/boolean.png"
    maxWidth="280px"
  />
- **code** opens a code editor so users can enter XML, HTML, JSON, etc.
  <Screenshot
    filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/input-types/code.png"
    maxWidth="420px"
  />
- **conditional** allows users to enter a series of logical conditionals.
  This is most notably used in the [branch](components/branch.mdx) component.
  <Screenshot
    filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/input-types/conditional.png"
    maxWidth="500px"
  />

### Creating Dropdown Menu Inputs

Rather than allowing integration builders to enter values for an input, you might want to have users choose a value from a list of possible values.
You can do that by making your input into a dropdown menu.

<Screenshot
  filename="custom-components/writing-custom-components/dropdown-input.png"
  maxWidth="500px"
/>

To create an input with a dropdown menu, add a `model` property to your input:

```ts
export const acmeEnvironment = input({
  label: "Acme Inc Environment to Use",
  placeholder: "ACME Environment",
  type: "string",
  required: true,
  model: [
    {
      label: "Production",
      value: "https://api.acme.com/",
    },
    {
      label: "Staging",
      value: "https://staging.acme.com/api",
    },
    {
      label: "Sandbox",
      value: "https://sandbox.acme.com/api",
    },
  ],
});
```

The `model` property should be an array of objects, with each object containing a `label` and a `value`.
The `label` is shown in the dropdown menu.
The `value` is passed in as the input's value to the custom component.

### Writing `perform` functions

Each action contains one `perform` function, which is an async function with two parameters that may or may not have a return value.
In this example `firstName`, `middleName`, and `lastName`, are input parameters for this `perform` function

```typescript {7-15}
const properFormatName = action({
  display: {
    label: "Properly Format Name",
    description: "Properly format a person's name (Last, First M.)",
  },
  perform: async (context, { firstName, middleName, lastName }) => {
    if (middleName) {
      return {
        data: `${lastName}, ${firstName} ${middleName[0]}.`,
      };
    } else {
      return { data: `${lastName}, ${firstName}` };
    }
  },
  inputs: { firstName, middleName, lastName },
});
```

### `perform` Function Parameters

The `perform` function takes two parameters, `context` and `params`, that can be destructured into their respective properties:

```typescript
perform: async (context, params) => {},
// or
perform: async (
  { logger, credential },
  { paramName1, paramName2, ... }
) => {},
```

### The `context` Parameter

The `context` parameter is an object that contains four attributes: `logger`, `credential`, `instanceState`, and `stepId`.

### `context.logger`

`context.logger` is a logging object and can be helpful to debug components.

```typescript
perform: async ({ logger }, params) => {
  logger.info("Things are going great");
  logger.warn("Now less great...");
};
```

### `context.credential`

`context.credential` is an object that stores information about any credentials tied to this action in the form

```typescript
{
  authorizationMethod:
    "api_key_secret" | "basic" | "private_key" | "api_key" | "oauth2" | "oauth2_client_credentials",
  fields: {
    FIELD_NAME: String,
    FIELD_NAME: String,
  },
}
```

The `fields` presented are dependent on what type of credential is passed in.
If, for example, you use the `basic` authorization type, the `credential` payload might read

```typescript
{
  authorizationMethod: "basic",
  fields: {
    username: "MyUser",
    password: "MyP@$$word",
  },
}
```

The credential parameter can be used in your custom component like this:

```typescript
perform: async ({ logger, credential }, params) => {
  logger.log(`Your basic auth username is "${credential.fields.username}"`);
};
```

### `context.instanceState`

`context.instanceState` is a key/value store that may be used to store small amounts of data which is persisted between instance executions.
It is most notably used by the [Persist Data](components/persist-data.mdx) and [Process Data](components/process-data.mdx) components, but you can use it in your custom components, too.

If, for example, a previous instance run saved a state key of `sampleKey`, you can reference `context.instanceState['sampleKey']` to access that key's value.

To do the reverse, and save data to instance state for subsequent runs, add a `state` property to your perform function's return value:

```typescript
return {
  data: "Some Data",
  state: { exampleKey: "example value", anotherKey: [1, 2, 3] },
};
```

:::note Persisted data is scoped per-instance
Persisted data is scoped **per-instance**.
So, the same integration deployed to two different customers would have two distinct `instanceState` stores.
One instance is not able to read from the other instance's `instanceState`.
:::

### `context.stepId`

`context.stepId` contains the unique identifier (UUID) of the step.
It is used by the [Process Data - DeDuplicate](components/process-data.mdx#deduplicate) action to track what items in a array have or have not been previously seen.
You can use it similarly in a custom component to persist step-specific data.

### The `params` Parameter

The `params` parameter is an object that has attributes for each input field the action supports.
For example, for the perform action [defined above](#writing-perform-functions), `params` has `params.firstName`, `params.middleName`, and `params.lastName`.

`firstName`, `middleName`, and `lastName` are based off of the input objects that are provided to the action as `inputs`.

:::note Shorthand property names
Note that we are using [shorthand property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) for inputs in our example.
If your input object variables have different names - say you have a `const myFirstNameInput = input ({...})`, you can structure your action's input property like this:

```typescript
inputs: {
    firstName: myFirstNameInput,
    middleName: myMiddleNameInput,
    lastName: myLastNameInput,
}
```

and the `params` object passed into `perform` will have keys `firstName`, `middleName`, and `lastName`.

Using non-shorthand property names is preferable to some developers to avoid [variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing).
:::

The function is written with a destructured `params` parameter.
It could be rewritten without being destructured.

```typescript {1-3,6}
perform: async (context, params) => {
  if (params.middleName == "") {
    return { data: `${params.lastName}, ${params.firstName}` };
  } else {
    return {
      data: `${params.lastName}, ${params.firstName} ${params.middleName[0]}.`,
    };
  }
},
```

### Coercing Input Types

TypeScript-based Node libraries often have strict rules about the type of variables that are passed into their functions, but inputs to `perform` functions are of type `unknown` since it's not known ahead of time what types of values users of components are going to pass in.
For example, you might expect one of your inputs to be a `number`, but a user might pass in a `string` instead.
That's obviously a problem since `"2" + 3` is `"23"`, while `2 + 3` is `5` in JavaScript.

The Spectral package includes several [utility functions](spectral/modules/_util_.md) for coercing input to be the type of variable that you need.
Looking at the number/string example, suppose you have some input - `quantity` - that you need turned into a number (even if someone passes in `"123.45"` as a string), and you have another input - `itemName` - that you'd like to be a string.
You can use `util.types.toNumber()` and `util.types.toString()` to ensure that the input has been converted to a number and string respectively:

```typescript
import { action, util } from "@-io/spectral";
import { someThirdPartyApiCall } from "some-example-third-party-library";

action({
  /*...*/
  perform: async (context, { quantity, itemName }) => {
    const response = await someThirdPartyApiCall({
      orderQuantity: util.types.toNumber(quantity), // Guaranteed to be a number
      orderItemName: util.types.toString(itemName), // Guaranteed to be a string
    });
    return { data: response };
  },
});
```

If an input cannot be coerced into the type you've chosen - for example, suppose you pass `"Hello World"` into `util.toNumber()` - an error will be thrown indicating that `"Hello World"` cannot be coerced into a number.

#### Writing Your Own Type Checking Functions

 provides a variety of type check and type coercion functions for common types (number, integer, string, boolean, etc).
If you require a uniquely shaped object, you can create your own type check and coercion functions to ensure that inputs your custom component receives have the proper shape that the libraries you rely on expect.

You can import an `interface` or `type` (or write one yourself) and write a function that converts inputs into an expected shape.
For example, the SendGrid SDK expects an object that has this form:

```json
{
  "to": [string],
  "from": string,
  "subject": string,
  "text": string,
  "html": string
}
```

We can pull in that defined type, `MailDataRequired`, from the SendGrid SDK, and write a function that takes inputs and converts them to an object containing a series of strings:

```typescript
import { MailDataRequired } from "@sendgrid/mail";
import { util } from "@-io/spectral";

export const createEmailPayload = ({
  to,
  from,
  subject,
  text,
  html,
}): MailDataRequired => ({
  to: util.types
    .toString(to)
    .split(",")
    .map((recipient: string) => recipient.trim()),
  from: util.types.toString(from),
  subject: util.types.toString(from),
  text: util.types.toString(text),
  html: util.types.toString(html),
});
```

### Component Outputs

In the example above, the function returns a string of the form `Last, First M.`.
This return value of a custom component is accessible to subsequent steps by referencing this step's `results`.
Component outputs can take many forms.
To return a simple string, number, boolean, array, or object your return block can read:

```typescript
// return a string:
return {
  data: "some string",
};
// return a number:
return {
  data: 123.45,
};
// return a boolean:
return {
  data: true,
};
// return an array:
return {
  data: [1, 2, 3, 4, "a", "b"],
};
// return an object:
return {
  data: {
    key1: "value1",
    key2: ["value2", 123],
  },
};
```

Those values can be used as inputs in subsequent steps by referencing this step's `results`.

### Outputting Binary Data

Some custom components will not output a number, string, boolean, array, or object, but will instead output an entire file (like an image, PDF, video, etc).
For those custom components, the return value will contain a file `Buffer` as the `data` return, and a `contentType` key to indicate kind of file is being returned.
See Mozilla's documentation for a list of common file [MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).

For example, if your custom component returns a rendered PDF file, and the PDF contents are saved in a `Buffer` variable named `pdfContents`, the return block might look like this:

```typescript
return {
  data: pdfContents,
  contentType: "application/pdf",
};
```

### Setting Synchronous HTTP Status Codes

If you invoke your instances [synchronously](integration-triggers.mdx#http-status-codes-for-synchronous-integrations) and would like to return an HTTP status code other than `200 - OK`, you can configure the final step of your integration to be a custom component that returns any HTTP status code you want.

To return an HTTP status code other than 200, return a `statusCode` attribute in the object you return from your custom component instead of a `data` attribute:

```typescript
return {
  statusCode: 415,
};
```

If this custom component is the last step of an integration, then the integration will return an HTTP status code of 415 if invoked synchronously.

Note: When an integration is invoked synchronously, the integration redirects the caller to a URL containing the output results of the final step of the integration.
If the final step of the integration is a [Stop Execution](components/stop-execution.mdx) action, or any custom component action that returns a `statusCode`, the redirect does not occur and the caller receives a `null` response body instead.
You should not return both `data` and `statusCode` attributes in a custom component.

## Exporting a Component

Component code contains a default export of `component` type.
A `component` contains a `key` that uniquely identifies it, whether or not it's `public`, some information about how the web app should `display` it, and an object containing the `actions` that the component is comprised of.
For the "proper and improper" names example component, the export can look like this:

```typescript
export default component({
  key: "format-name",
  public: false,
  display: {
    label: "Format Name",
    description: "Format a person's name given a first, middle, and last name",
    iconPath: "icon.png",
  },
  actions: {
    improperFormatName,
    properFormatName,
  },
});
```

## Testing a Component

It's important to have good unit tests for software - custom components are no exception.
You want to catch errors or breaking changes before they wreak havoc on your customers' integrations.
's Spectral library provides some utility functions to make writing unit tests easier.

In the examples below, we assume that you use the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework which is installed by default when you run `prism components:init`.
You can swap Jest out for another testing framework if you like.

### Test File Naming Conventions

To create a unit test file, create a new file alongside your code that has the extension `test.ts` (rather than `.ts`).
For example, if your code lives in `index.ts`, create a file named `index.test.ts`.
If you separate out your component actions into `actions.ts`, create a corresponding `actions.test.ts`.

### Testing Component Actions

As described [above](#perform-function-parameters) a component action's `perform` function takes two arguments:

- `context` is an object that contains a `logger` and `credential`.
- `params` is an object that contains input parameters as key-value pairs.

Test `logger` and `credential` parameters are described below.
Let's ignore them for now and look at the `params` object.
Consider the example "Format Proper Name" action described previously:

```typescript
export const properFormatName = action({
  display: {
    label: "Properly Format Name",
    description: "Properly format a person's name (Last, First M.)",
  },
  perform: async (context, { firstName, middleName, lastName }) => {
    if (middleName) {
      return {
        data: `${lastName}, ${firstName} ${middleName[0]}.`,
      };
    } else {
      return { data: `${lastName}, ${firstName}` };
    }
  },
  inputs: { firstName, middleName, lastName },
});
```

You can use the `@-io/spectral/dist/testing/invoke` function to test an invocation of that action.
The `invoke` function takes two required and one optional parameters:

- The action's definition (i.e. `properFormatNameAction`)
- An object containing input parameters
- An object containing a logger or credentials (optional)

A Jest test file, then, could look like this:

```typescript
import { properFormatName } from ".";
import { invoke } from "@-io/spectral/dist/testing";

describe("Test the Proper Name formatter", () => {
  test("Verify first, middle, and last name", async () => {
    const { result } = await invoke(properFormatName, {
      firstName: "John",
      middleName: "James",
      lastName: "Doe",
    });
    expect(result.data).toStrictEqual("Doe, John J.");
  });
  test("Verify first and last name without middle", async () => {
    const { result } = await invoke(properFormatName, {
      firstName: "John",
      middleName: null,
      lastName: "Doe",
    });
    expect(result.data).toStrictEqual("Doe, John");
  });
});
```

You can then run `yarn run jest`, and Jest will run each test, returning an error code if a test failed.

### Verifying Correct Logging in Action Tests

You may want to verify that your action generates some logs of particular severities in certain situations.
The `invoke` function mentioned above also returns an object, `loggerMock`, with information on what was logged during the action invocation.

You can use Jest to verify that certain lines were logged like this:

```typescript
test("Ensure that an error is logged", async () => {
  const level = "error";
  const message = "Error code 42 occurred.";
  const { loggerMock } = await invoke(myExampleAction, {
    exampleInput1,
    exampleInput2,
  });
  expect(loggerMock[level]).toHaveBeenCalledWith(message);
});
```

In the above example, the test would pass if an `error` log line of `Error code 42 occurred.` were generated, and would fail otherwise.

### Providing Test Credentials to an Action Test

Many actions require credentials to interact with third-party services.
You can create a credential object using `@/spectral/dist/testing/credentials/*` functions:

```typescript
import { credentials } from "@-io/spectral/dist/testing";

const myBasicAuthTestCredential = credentials.basic("myUsername", "myPassword");
console.log(myBasicAuthTestCredential);
/*
  {
    authorizationMethod: 'basic',
    fields: { username: 'myUsername', password: 'myPassword' }
  }
*/
```

It's not good practice to hard-code credentials.
Please use best practices, like setting environment variables to store credentials in your CI/CD environment:

```typescript
import { credentials } from "@-io/spectral/dist/testing";

const myAwsTestCredential = credentials.apiKeySecret(
  process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
);
console.log(myAwsTestCredential);
/*
  {
    authorizationMethod: 'api_key_secret',
    fields: {
      api_key: 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
      api_secret: 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
    }
  }
*/
```

A full list of `credientials.*` functions is available in the [Spectral typedocs](spectral/modules/_testing_.md#const-credentials).

Credentials can then be passed in as part of the `context` parameter to the `invoke` function, using the `credential` key:

```typescript
import { saveFile } from "./actions";
import { credentials, invoke } from "@-io/spectral/dist/testing";

const myAwsTestCredential = credentials.apiKeySecret(
  process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
);

test("Test saving a file", async () => {
  const { result } = await invoke(
    saveFile,
    {
      filePath: "/path/to/file.txt",
      fileContents: "Hello world!",
    },
    {
      credential: myAwsTestCredential,
    }
  );
});
```

## Publishing a Component

Package a component with `webpack` by running `npm run build` or `yarn build`:

```bash
$ yarn build
yarn run v1.22.10
$ webpack

```

This will create a `dist/` directory containing your compiled JavaScript and icon image.
Now use `prism` to publish your component.
If you do not have 's CLI tool, `prism`, installed, please take a moment to look through the [Prism overview page](cli/cli-usage.mdx).

```bash
$ prism components:publish

Format Name - Format a person's name given a first, middle, and last name
Would you like to publish Format Name? (y/N): y
Successfully submitted Format Name (v6)! The publish should finish processing shortly.
```

## Upgrading Spectral Versions

We release minor, non-breaking changes to Spectral often, and major changes periodically.
Major changes come with major version bumps (1.x.x, 2.x.x, 3.x.x, etc).

To upgrade a component from an older major version of spectral to a new one, see our upgrade guides:

- [Spectral 2.x upgrade guide](spectral/spectral-2-upgrade-guide.mdx)
- [Spectral 3.x upgrade guide](spectral/spectral-3-upgrade-guide.mdx)

If you are building a new component, we strongly encourage you to start with the latest version of Spectral.
