import { Launch } from "@mui/icons-material";

 provides a JavaScript library, [@-io/spectral](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@-io/spectral), which provides [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type definitions for use in component development.
Spectral's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/-io/spectral).

## Installation

To add spectral to a project, run

```bash
npm install @-io/spectral
```

Import `input`, `component`, `connection`, `trigger` and `action` types by adding the following to the top of your component code

```none
import { action, component, connection, input, trigger } from "@-io/spectral";
```

## Writing Custom components

Please see the [writing custom components](custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx) article to see how to use `@-io/spectral`.

If you are new to custom components, consider working through the [writing your first custom component](quickstarts/first-custom-component.mdx) quickstart.
